# Molina Portfolio

## Purpose
This is a quiz game on some JavaScript fundamentals and basics. I had to look up how to create a timer(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/js-building-countdown-timer), and an array that lets me insert questions with answers(credit: https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/.) The Styles I used for this are similar to the ones I used in my porfolio assignment as i really like the colors. I made use of the display: none; feature here to display and hide content whenever necessary. This was a tough challenge, so there are many things i still need to learn!
